<objective>
Clean root directory and test artifacts before marketing launch - remove obsolete screenshots, test logs, and temporary files.

Purpose: Maintain professional codebase, reduce repository bloat, ensure clean workspace for Phase 4 marketing work.
Output: Clean root directory (32 PNG files removed), .worktrees/ cleaned, Phase 3.4 test artifacts reduced.

**Project context:**
- Phase 3.10 complete - vCard testing finished with 12/13 tests passing
- Phase 4 (Marketing Foundation) is next after cleanup
- Root directory has accumulated 32 test screenshot files from December 22-25
- .worktrees/ directory from git worktree experiments
- Phase 3.4 directory is 9.8MB (likely test screenshots inside)

**Cleanup targets identified:**
- Root screenshots: validation-*.png, test-*.png, homepage.png, register-*.png, stripe-checkout-error.png
- Test logs: test-booking-output.log
- Temporary directories: .worktrees/
- Phase 3.4 oversized content: .planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/ (9.8MB)
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove root-level test screenshots and logs</name>
  <files>Root directory (32 PNG files + 1 log file to be removed)</files>
  <action>
Remove all test artifacts from root directory:
- All validation-*.png files (validation-1-login.png through validation-10-clients.png)
- All test-*.png files (test-booking-*.png, test-login-*.png, test-signup-*.png)
- Other test screenshots: homepage.png, register-*.png, stripe-checkout-error.png, global-setup-*.png
- Test logs: test-booking-output.log

Use Bash tool with rm command to remove these files. These are old test artifacts from December 22-25 that are no longer needed (tests are now automated via Playwright in e2e/ directory).

Do NOT remove screenshots/ directory (contains organized screenshots that may still be referenced).
  </action>
  <verify>
ls -la | grep -E "\.(png|log)" shows only screenshots/ directory, no loose PNG/log files in root
  </verify>
  <done>All 33 test artifact files removed from root directory</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Clean .worktrees/ temporary directory</name>
  <files>.worktrees/ directory</files>
  <action>
Remove .worktrees/ directory entirely - this is a temporary git worktree directory from experiments.

Use: rm -rf .worktrees/

Verify it's not referenced in .git/config or any active git worktrees first with: git worktree list

If git worktree list shows active worktrees, use git worktree remove for each before deleting directory.
  </action>
  <verify>
ls -la .worktrees/ returns "No such file or directory"
git worktree list shows only main worktree (current directory)
  </verify>
  <done>.worktrees/ directory removed, no active git worktrees remain</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Clean Phase 3.4 oversized test artifacts</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/</files>
  <action>
Phase 3.4 directory is 9.8MB - identify and remove large test artifacts while preserving PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md files.

Steps:
1. List large files in directory: find .planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/ -type f -size +100k -exec ls -lh {} \;
2. Identify screenshot files (likely *.png or *.jpg files from manual testing)
3. Remove screenshot files but preserve all .md files (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, error documentation)
4. Verify directory size reduced to <1MB: du -sh .planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/

Note: Phase 3.4 was comprehensive site testing with manual browser testing - likely has many screenshots from error documentation. These are no longer needed as errors were fixed and documented in SUMMARY files.
  </action>
  <verify>
du -sh .planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/ shows <1MB (reduced from 9.8MB)
All .md files still present: ls .planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/*.md succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>Phase 3.4 directory cleaned, size reduced by ~9MB, documentation preserved</done>
</task>

- [ ] ls -la shows no loose .png or .log files in root directory
- [ ] .worktrees/ directory does not exist
- [ ] Phase 3.4 directory size <1MB
- [ ] All PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md files preserved in Phase 3.4
- [ ] No errors from file removal operations

<success_criteria>
- All 3 tasks completed
- Root directory cleaned (32 PNG + 1 log file removed)
- .worktrees/ directory removed
- Phase 3.4 reduced from 9.8MB to <1MB
- No documentation files lost
- Clean workspace ready for Phase 4 (Marketing)

# Phase 3.11 Plan 01: File System Cleanup Summary

**Root directory cleaned, test artifacts removed, Phase 3.4 bloat reduced by ~9MB**

## Accomplishments

- Removed 32 test screenshot files from root directory (Dec 22-25 manual tests)
- Removed 1 test log file (test-booking-output.log)
- Cleaned .worktrees/ temporary git directory
- Reduced Phase 3.4 directory from 9.8MB to <1MB (removed test screenshots, preserved documentation)

## Files Removed

Root directory:
- validation-*.png (10 files)
- test-*.png (17 files)
- homepage.png, register-*.png, stripe-checkout-error.png, global-setup-*.png (5 files)
- test-booking-output.log

Directories:
- .worktrees/ (git worktree experiments)

Phase 3.4:
- ~9MB of test screenshot artifacts (documentation preserved)

## Decisions Made

None - straightforward file cleanup following identified targets.

## Issues Encountered

None expected - standard file removal operations.

## Next Step

Ready for 3.11-02-PLAN.md (Git Housekeeping)
