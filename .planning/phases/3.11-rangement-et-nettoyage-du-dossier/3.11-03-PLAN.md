<objective>
Resolve Phase 3.9.4 duplicate directory issue and validate .planning/ structure before marketing launch.

Purpose: Clean up planning directory confusion, ensure all summaries are in correct locations, maintain organized documentation structure.
Output: Phase 3.9.4 duplicate resolved, .planning/ structure validated, documentation organized.

**Prior plan context:**
- Plan 01 cleaned root directory and Phase 3.4 bloat
- Plan 02 committed planning files and validated .gitignore

**Phase directory issue identified:**
- Two Phase 3.9.4 directories exist:
  - `3.9.4-clients-enrichis-vcard/` (88K)
  - `3.9.4-modes-affichage-multiples-clients/` (52K)
- Need to determine which is correct and consolidate

**Phase directory structure:**
Current: `.planning/phases/[phase-number]-[phase-name]/[phase]-[plan]-[PLAN|SUMMARY].md`

Expected:
- Each phase has ONE directory
- Multiple plans within that directory (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- Each plan has PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Resolve Phase 3.9.4 duplicate directory</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/3.9.4-*/</files>
  <action>
Investigate and resolve duplicate Phase 3.9.4 directories:

Steps:
1. List contents of both directories:
   - ls -la .planning/phases/3.9.4-clients-enrichis-vcard/
   - ls -la .planning/phases/3.9.4-modes-affichage-multiples-clients/

2. Read PLAN/SUMMARY files in each to determine scope:
   - Check if they're different features or duplicate work
   - Read first few lines of PLAN.md files to understand objectives

3. Decision logic:
   - If both directories contain DIFFERENT work (different plan numbers): Keep both, but rename to 3.9.4 and 3.9.5
   - If one directory is obsolete/duplicate: Remove obsolete directory, keep authoritative one
   - If directories should be merged: Move files to single directory, remove duplicate

4. Check ROADMAP.md to confirm Phase 3.9.4 intended scope:
   - Grep for "Phase 3.9.4" in ROADMAP.md
   - Verify which directory matches roadmap description

5. Take action based on findings and commit directory structure fix.

Note: ROADMAP.md shows "Phase 3.9.4: Clients enrichis compatible vCard (INSERTED)" - suggests "clients-enrichis-vcard" is correct name. "modes-affichage-multiples-clients" might be a sub-feature or separate phase that should be 3.10 or merged.
  </action>
  <verify>
Only ONE directory exists for Phase 3.9.4 in .planning/phases/
ls .planning/phases/ | grep "3.9.4" returns single result
All relevant PLAN/SUMMARY files preserved in correct directory
  </verify>
  <done>Phase 3.9.4 directory structure resolved, no duplicates remain</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Validate .planning/ structure organization</name>
  <files>.planning/</files>
  <action>
Validate overall .planning/ directory structure follows conventions:

Checks:
1. All phase directories follow naming: [phase-number]-[kebab-case-name]/
   - List all: ls .planning/phases/
   - Verify format consistency

2. Each phase directory contains only PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md files (plus any CONTEXT.md, DISCOVERY.md):
   - find .planning/phases/ -type f ! -name "*.md" -a ! -name ".DS_Store"
   - Should return empty or only .DS_Store files

3. All PLAN files follow naming: [phase]-[plan]-PLAN.md
   - find .planning/phases/ -name "*PLAN.md" | grep -v "[0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-PLAN.md"
   - Should return empty (all PLAN files follow pattern)

4. All SUMMARY files follow naming: [phase]-[plan]-SUMMARY.md
   - find .planning/phases/ -name "*SUMMARY.md" | grep -v "[0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-SUMMARY.md"
   - Should return empty (all SUMMARY files follow pattern)

5. Check for orphaned files (files outside phase directories):
   - ls .planning/*.md should only show: PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, ISSUES.md
   - Any other .md files are potentially misplaced

If issues found: Document in summary for later cleanup (don't fix in this task - scope is validation only).
  </action>
  <verify>
All checks pass:
- Phase directories follow naming convention
- Only .md files in phase directories
- PLAN/SUMMARY files follow [phase]-[plan]-[TYPE].md pattern
- No orphaned files in .planning/ root
  </verify>
  <done>.planning/ structure validated, any issues documented</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Only one Phase 3.9.4 directory exists
- [ ] All phase directories follow naming convention
- [ ] No non-.md files in phase directories (except .DS_Store)
- [ ] PLAN/SUMMARY files follow naming pattern
- [ ] No orphaned documentation in .planning/ root
- [ ] Structure is clean and organized for Phase 4 work

<success_criteria>
- All 2 tasks completed
- Phase 3.9.4 duplicate directory resolved
- .planning/ structure validated and organized
- Documentation easy to navigate
- Clean baseline for Phase 4 (Marketing Foundation)
- Phase 3.11 complete - ready for marketing launch
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/3.11-rangement-et-nettoyage-du-dossier/3.11-03-SUMMARY.md`:

# Phase 3.11 Plan 03: Documentation Organization Summary

**.planning/ structure validated, Phase 3.9.4 duplicate resolved, clean documentation baseline for Phase 4**

## Accomplishments

- Resolved Phase 3.9.4 duplicate directory issue
- Validated .planning/ directory structure follows conventions
- Documented any organizational issues for future cleanup
- Established clean documentation baseline for Phase 4 (Marketing Foundation)

## Files Created/Modified

[Document which Phase 3.9.4 directory was kept/removed/renamed]
[Document any structure validation findings]

## Decisions Made

[Document decision on Phase 3.9.4 duplicate:
- Which directory kept as authoritative
- Rationale for choice based on ROADMAP.md and content
- Any files moved or consolidated]

## Issues Encountered

[Document any structure validation issues found but not fixed in this plan]

## Next Step

**Phase 3.11 COMPLETE** - Project cleanup finished

Ready for Phase 4 (Marketing Foundation):
- Root directory cleaned (32 test files removed)
- Git housekeeping complete (planning files committed)
- Documentation organized (.planning/ structure validated)
- Clean workspace for marketing launch work

Run `/gsd:progress` to review overall project status and next phase planning.
