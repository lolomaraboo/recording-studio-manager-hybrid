# Phase 3.11 Plan 01: File System Cleanup Summary

**Root directory cleaned (32 PNG files removed), .worktrees/ directory removed, Phase 3.4 reduced from 9.8MB to 908KB**

## Accomplishments

- ✅ Removed 32 test screenshot files from root directory (Dec 22-25 manual tests)
- ✅ Removed 1 test log file (test-booking-output.log)
- ✅ Cleaned .worktrees/ temporary git directory (2 worktrees removed)
- ✅ Reduced Phase 3.4 directory from 9.8MB to 908KB (~9MB reduction)
- ✅ All documentation preserved (58 markdown files in Phase 3.4)

## Files Removed

**Root directory (33 files total):**
- validation-*.png (10 files) - Manual validation screenshots from Dec 22-25
- test-*.png (17 files) - Manual test screenshots from Dec 22-25
- homepage.png, register-*.png, stripe-checkout-error.png, global-setup-*.png (5 files)
- test-booking-output.log (1 file)

**Directories:**
- .worktrees/ - Git worktree experiments (2 active worktrees removed first)
  - Removed: /Users/marabook_m1/.claude-worktrees/recording-studio-manager-hybrid/cool-solomon (prunable)
  - Removed: .worktrees/001-verify-file-organization-and-correct-placement (forced removal)

**Phase 3.4 (9MB reduction):**
- screenshots/ directory - 27 PNG files (274KB to 1.0MB each)
- errors/ directory - 1 PNG file (271KB)
- 3 root-level PNG files (233KB to 332KB each)
- Total reduction: 9.8MB → 908KB (90.7% size reduction)

## Decisions Made

None - straightforward file cleanup following identified targets.

## Issues Encountered

None - all cleanup operations successful:
- Root PNG/log cleanup: 32 files removed successfully
- Git worktrees: 2 worktrees properly removed via `git worktree remove` before directory deletion
- Phase 3.4 cleanup: Screenshot directories removed, all 58 markdown documentation files preserved

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

✅ **Ready for 3.11-02-PLAN.md (Git Housekeeping)**

**Blockers:** None

**Concerns:** None - repository cleanup successful, workspace professional

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~5 min
- **Files removed:** 62 files total (33 root + 29 Phase 3.4)
- **Disk space freed:** ~9.9MB (mostly Phase 3.4 screenshots)
- **Documentation preserved:** 58 markdown files in Phase 3.4 intact
- **Git worktrees cleaned:** 2 worktrees removed properly

## Verification

- ✅ `ls -la | grep -E "\.(png|log)"` shows no results (root directory clean)
- ✅ `.worktrees/` directory does not exist
- ✅ `git worktree list` shows only main worktree
- ✅ Phase 3.4 directory: 908KB (from 9.8MB)
- ✅ All Phase 3.4 .md files present: 58 files preserved

## Next Step

Ready for Phase 3.11-02-PLAN.md (Git Housekeeping) - organize git history, clean branches, validate repository structure.
