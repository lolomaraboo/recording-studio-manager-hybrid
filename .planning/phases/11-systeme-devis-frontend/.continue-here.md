Phase 11 Plan 1 execution paused at Task 4 (human-verify checkpoint). All 3 auto tasks completed and committed. Browser automation testing started but revealed critical bug: backend server not running. Fixed clientId=0 Select component bug discovered during testing.

**What's blocking:**
Backend server (port 3001) not running - all tRPC mutations return 400 errors. Cannot complete verification without backend.

**Files modified but NOT committed:**
- packages/client/src/pages/QuoteCreate.tsx (bug fix: clientId initialization)
</current_state>

<completed_work>
✅ **Task 1: Line items builder in QuoteCreate.tsx**
- Removed simple subtotal field
- Added LineItem type and state management (items array)
- Implemented handlers: handleAddItem, handleRemoveItem, handleItemChange
- Auto-calculation: amount = quantity × unitPrice (real-time)
- Totals calculation: subtotal, taxAmount, total
- UI: 12-column grid layout (description 5 cols, qty 2, price 2, amount 2, delete 1)
- Validation: minimum 1 item with description required
- Mutation updated: sends items array to backend

✅ **Task 2: PDF download in QuoteDetail.tsx**
- Added generatePDFMutation with base64 decoding logic
- Decodes base64 → Uint8Array → Blob → download link
- Button shows loading state: "Génération..." during mutation
- Success toast with filename
- Error handling with toast

✅ **Task 3: State transition buttons in QuoteDetail.tsx**
- Added 6 mutations: sendMutation, acceptMutation, rejectMutation, cancelMutation, convertMutation (+ existing generatePDFMutation)
- Implemented 6 handlers: handleSend, handleAccept, handleReject, handleCancel, handleConvertToProject, handleDownloadPDF
- New "Actions" card section with conditional rendering:
  - draft: "Envoyer au client", "Annuler"
  - sent (not expired): "Accepter", "Refuser", "Annuler"
  - accepted: "Convertir en projet"
  - expired/rejected/cancelled/converted: Informational message only
- All buttons show loading states (isPending)
- Navigation to /projects/:id after successful conversion
- Updated header buttons: removed old placeholder buttons, kept only "Télécharger PDF", "Modifier", "Supprimer"

✅ **Bug fix: clientId=0 Select component issue**
- Problem: Initial clientId: 0 doesn't match any Select option, component fails to update
- Solution: Changed initial state from 0 to undefined
- Updated Select value binding: `value={formData.clientId?.toString() ?? ""}`
- Updated projectId similarly: `value={formData.projectId?.toString() ?? "0"}`
- Validation already correct: `if (!formData.clientId)` works for undefined
</completed_work>

⏳ **Task 4: Human-verify checkpoint (NOT started)**

Need to verify via browser automation after backend starts:

1. **Quote Creation with Line Items:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5174/quotes
   - Click "Nouveau devis"
   - Select client from dropdown
   - Test line items builder:
     - Add 3 items: "Enregistrement (4h)" qty:4 price:75 = 300€, "Mixage" qty:1 price:200 = 200€, "Mastering" qty:1 price:150 = 150€
     - Verify totals: Subtotal 650€, TVA 20% = 130€, Total 780€
     - Test add/remove item buttons
     - Test auto-calculation on quantity/price change
   - Submit form
   - Verify redirect to /quotes with success toast

2. **Quote Detail View:**
   - Click created quote
   - Verify all details display
   - Verify line items table shows 3 items
   - Verify status badge "Brouillon"

3. **PDF Generation:**
   - Click "Télécharger PDF"
   - Verify loading state "Génération..."
   - Verify PDF downloads (quote-Q-2026-NNNN.pdf)
   - Verify PDF content (header, client, 3 line items, totals, terms, notes)

4. **State Transitions:**
   - Draft → Send: Click "Envoyer au client", verify status "Envoyé"
   - Sent → Accept: Click "Accepter", verify status "Accepté"
   - Accepted → Convert: Click "Convertir en projet", verify redirect to /projects/:id

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Try submit with no line items → validation error
   - Try remove last item → button disabled
   - Verify responsive layout at 375px mobile width

**After verification passes:**
- Create 11-01-SUMMARY.md
- Update STATE.md (position, performance metrics)
- Update ROADMAP.md (plan 11-01 complete)
- Commit all changes with feat(11-01) message
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
1. **clientId/projectId initialization:**
   - Changed from `0` to `undefined` to fix Select component bug
   - Reason: Select component with value="0" but no matching option prevents updates
   - Optional chaining in value binding ensures graceful handling

2. **Line items builder implementation:**
   - Chose controlled components with useState array over uncontrolled forms
   - Real-time amount calculation improves UX (no need to click "calculate")
   - displayOrder field managed automatically via array index
   - Minimum 1 item validation prevents empty quotes

3. **PDF download approach:**
   - Backend returns base64 for tRPC compatibility (can't send binary over tRPC easily)
   - Frontend decodes base64 → Uint8Array → Blob for download
   - Automatic download via temporary anchor element (standard pattern)

4. **State transitions UI:**
   - Conditional rendering based on status + isExpired flag
   - Actions in separate card section (not in header) for clarity
   - Loading states on all mutations prevent double-click
   - Navigate to created project after conversion (better UX than staying on quote)

5. **Header buttons simplification:**
   - Removed old placeholder buttons (Send Email, Convert to Invoice)
   - Kept essential actions: Download PDF, Edit, Delete
   - State transitions moved to dedicated Actions section

6. **TypeScript compilation:**
   - Verified no errors introduced in QuoteCreate.tsx or QuoteDetail.tsx
   - Pre-existing errors in other files (BookingDetail, AIAssistant, etc.) ignored
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
**CRITICAL:** Backend server not running on port 3001

- All tRPC mutations return 400 errors
- Cannot test quote creation, PDF generation, or state transitions
- Need to start backend with: `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/rsm_master" pnpm --filter server dev`

**Resolution:**
Start backend server before resuming verification tests. Server must be running on port 3001 for tRPC endpoint to be accessible.

<context>
**Execution strategy used:** Pattern C (Decision-Dependent)
The plan has 1 checkpoint at the end (human-verify), so I executed all 3 auto tasks sequentially in main context rather than spawning subagents. This was appropriate because:
- Only 3 auto tasks (simple scope)
- Single checkpoint at end for verification
- No segmentation benefit

**Mental model:**
Phase 10 (backend) is complete with database schema, tRPC router (7-state FSM), and PDF generation service. Phase 11-01 completes the frontend UI to make the backend functional for users. The three components work together:
1. QuoteCreate = Entry point (user creates quotes with line items)
2. QuoteDetail PDF = Output (user downloads professional quote PDF)
3. QuoteDetail Actions = Workflow (user progresses quote through lifecycle)

The 7-state FSM is:
draft → send → sent → accept/reject → accepted/rejected → convert → converted_to_project
            ↓                    ↓
         cancel              cancel
            ↓                    ↓
       cancelled           cancelled

Plus automatic expiry: sent + (date > validUntil) = isExpired flag

**Bug discovery during testing:**
Browser automation revealed that Select component with initial value "0" (no matching option) prevents onValueChange from firing. Fixed by initializing to undefined and using optional chaining in value binding.

**Code quality:**
- Followed Phase 3.14 UI harmonization patterns (container pt-2 pb-4 px-2, icons text-primary, cards pb-3)
- Used existing patterns from Clients.tsx, InvoiceCreate.tsx for consistency
- Type-safe with TypeScript strict mode
- Real-time updates with tRPC automatic cache invalidation (refetch after mutations)

<next_action>
**When resuming:**

1. **Start backend server:**
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/rsm_master" pnpm --filter server dev
   ```
   Wait for server to start on port 3001

2. **Commit bug fix:**
   ```bash
   git add packages/client/src/pages/QuoteCreate.tsx
   git commit -m "fix(11-01): Fix clientId=0 Select component bug preventing quote creation"
   ```

3. **Start fresh browser automation tests:**
   ```
   Use mcp__claude-in-chrome tools to:
   - Navigate to localhost:5174/quotes
   - Click "Nouveau devis" button
   - Complete full verification checklist from Task 4
   ```

4. **If all tests pass:**
   - Type "approved" to checkpoint
   - Workflow will auto-create SUMMARY.md
   - Workflow will auto-update STATE.md + ROADMAP.md
   - Workflow will auto-commit with feat(11-01) message

5. **If tests reveal bugs:**
   - Fix bugs immediately (deviation rules apply)
   - Re-run verification
   - Document deviations in SUMMARY.md

**First command to run after backend starts:**
```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate to http://localhost:5174/quotes
```

**Dev servers needed:**
- Backend: port 3001 (currently NOT running - START THIS FIRST)
- Frontend: port 5174 (already running ✓)
- Database: PostgreSQL localhost:5432 (assumed running)
