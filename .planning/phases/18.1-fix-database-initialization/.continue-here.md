# Phase 18.1-01 Execution Paused

**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Paused at:** Task 1 (migration generation) - NOT STARTED
**Reason:** Discovered scope is much larger than originally planned

## What We Discovered

Original plan assumed:
- Local database needs schema sync
- Simple migration generation + apply locally

**Reality discovered:**
- BOTH local AND production are missing Phase 10-17 tables (7 tables total)
- No migrations generated since Dec 15, 2025 (Phase 3)
- Local Docker completely corrupted (master empty, tenant mixed)
- VPS Production missing 7 tables but otherwise healthy

## Decision Point

Before continuing Phase 18.1-01, we need to define:

1. **Scope:** Fix local only OR fix both local + production?
2. **Workflow:** Generate migrations once, then apply sequentially?
3. **Risk management:** How to safely update production with customer data?
4. **Testing strategy:** How to validate each step before moving to next?
5. **Rollback plan:** What if something goes wrong?

## Documentation Created

- `.planning/DATABASE-INVENTORY.md` - Complete audit of all environments
- Git commits: 52dc513, 7b71552

## Next Action

Define GSD workflow for database synchronization before resuming execution.
