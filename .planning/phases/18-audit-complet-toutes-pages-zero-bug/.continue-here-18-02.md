# Phase 18-02: Execute Manual Tests - PAUSED

## Current State

**Environment Setup Complete, Ready for Manual Testing**

- ✅ Database environment ready (tenant_1 with test data)
- ✅ Test headers fixed (user 3 / org 1 instead of user 4 / org 16)
- ✅ Application running (frontend: 5174, backend: 3001)
- ✅ Chrome connected and tested 3 pages (Dashboard, Clients, Sessions)

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:**
- User clarified testing approach: **MANUAL testing with Claude as guide**
- I initially misunderstood and started automated testing with Chrome MCP
- Correct approach: User tests pages manually, Claude provides checklist guidance

## Completed Work

**Task 1: Environment Setup - ✅ COMPLETE**
- Database credentials fixed in .continue-here.md (user 3 / org 1)
- Test headers corrected in `packages/client/src/main.tsx`:
  - Changed from: `x-test-user-id: '4'` / `x-test-org-id: '16'`
  - Changed to: `x-test-user-id: '3'` / `x-test-org-id: '1'`
- Application accessible at http://localhost:5174
- Initial smoke tests passed:
  - Dashboard loads with correct data (5 clients, 4 rooms, 6 equipment, 3 projects)
  - Clients page loads (5 clients displayed)
  - Sessions page loads (4 sessions displayed)

**Task 2: Test Admin Dashboard - ⏸️ PAUSED (0/44 pages fully tested)**
- Only did quick validation of 3 pages (Dashboard, Clients, Sessions)
- No systematic 27-check validation performed yet
- No bugs documented yet

## Remaining Work

**Task 2: Test Admin Dashboard (44 pages)** - NOT STARTED
- Group 1: Core Entities (20 pages) - Dashboard, Clients, Sessions, Projects, Tracks
- Group 2: v4.0 Features (10 pages) - Quotes, Invoices, Time Tracking
- Group 3: Reports & Analytics (4 pages)
- Group 4: Configuration (10 pages) - Team, Rooms, Equipment, Service Catalog, Settings
- Group 5: Features (3 pages) - Notifications, AI Chat, Command Palette

**Task 3: Test Client Portal (7 pages)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 4: Test Super Admin (4 pages)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 5: Test Public/Auth (4 pages)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 6: Test E2E Workflows (4 workflows)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 7: Mobile Testing (Selective)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 8: Dark Mode Testing (Selective)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 9: Update TEST-MATRIX.md Summary** - NOT STARTED

## Decisions Made

1. **Test Credentials Fixed**
   - User: alice@studiopro.com (User ID: 3)
   - Organization: Studio Pro (Org ID: 1)
   - Tenant: tenant_1
   - Rationale: Database reset created only tenant_1, old headers pointed to non-existent org 16

2. **Testing Approach Clarified**
   - User does MANUAL testing in browser
   - Claude provides checklist guidance (27 checks per page)
   - Rationale: User clarified this was always the plan, I misunderstood initially

3. **Bug Documentation Strategy**
   - Option 1 + 3: Local file (BUGS-PHASE-18.md) + immediate GitHub Issues
   - Rationale: Fast tracking + immediate issue creation for visibility

## Blockers

**None currently** - Environment ready, approach clarified, ready to begin systematic testing.

## Context

**What happened:**
- Started Phase 18-02 after completing database reset (Phase 18.3-01)
- Fixed test headers to match new database (org 1 instead of org 16)
- Started automated testing with Chrome MCP tools
- User clarified the correct approach: manual testing with Claude guidance

**Testing Strategy (Option A - Complete):**
- 58 pages × 27 checks = 1,566 total validations
- 2-3 days intensive manual testing
- Focus: P0/P1/P2 bugs must be found and documented

**Mental Model:**
Think of Claude as a QA guide with the TEST-MATRIX.md checklist. For each page:
1. User navigates to page in browser
2. Claude provides checklist (Functionality A, UI/UX B, Interactions C)
3. User validates each check
4. User reports results (PASS/FAIL + description if bug)
5. Claude documents bugs immediately in BUGS-PHASE-18.md + creates GitHub Issue
6. Move to next page

**Key Files:**
- `.planning/phases/18-audit-complet-toutes-pages-zero-bug/TEST-MATRIX.md` - Testing checklist
- `.planning/phases/18-audit-complet-toutes-pages-zero-bug/18-02-PLAN.md` - Detailed plan
- `packages/client/src/main.tsx:54-57` - Test headers (modified)

## Next Action

**When resuming:**

1. **Start systematic testing of Admin Dashboard Group 1**
   - Begin with page 1: Dashboard (http://localhost:5174)
   - User navigates to page
   - Claude provides 27-check checklist from TEST-MATRIX.md
   - User validates each check, reports results
   - Document any bugs found

2. **For EACH page, Claude should:**
   - Read the 27 checks from TEST-MATRIX.md for that page
   - Present checks in digestible groups (Functionality, UI/UX, Interactions)
   - Ask user for validation results after each group
   - Document bugs immediately if found
   - Create GitHub Issue for each bug
   - Update TEST-MATRIX.md with PASS/FAIL status
   - Move to next page

3. **Commit progress every 5-10 pages**

**First prompt when resuming:**
"Ready to start Phase 18-02 manual testing. Let's begin with Dashboard (page 1/58). I'll guide you through the 27 validation checks."

## Files Modified (Uncommitted)

- `packages/client/src/main.tsx` (lines 54-57) - Test headers changed from org 16 to org 1

**Commit needed:**
```bash
git add packages/client/src/main.tsx
git commit -m "fix(dev): update test headers to org 1 for Phase 18-02 testing"
```
