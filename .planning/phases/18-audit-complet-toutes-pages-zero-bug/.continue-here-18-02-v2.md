# Phase 18-02: Execute Manual Tests - PAUSED (Session 2)

## Current State

**Ready to resume Page 3: Clients - Detail**

- ✅ Environment running (frontend: 5174, backend: 3001, tenant_1)
- ✅ Test headers confirmed (user 3 / org 1)
- ✅ 2 pages tested and passed (Dashboard, Clients List)
- ⏳ Page 3: Clients - Detail - READY TO START (user was about to test)

**User confirmed:** We were at Clients Detail page testing, not Dashboard.

## Completed Work

**Task 1: Environment Setup - ✅ COMPLETE**
- Database environment ready (tenant_1 with test data)
- Test headers fixed (user 3 / org 1 instead of user 4 / org 16)
- Application running (frontend: 5174, backend: 3001)
- Credentials documented

**Task 2: Test Admin Dashboard - 🟡 IN PROGRESS (2/44 pages tested)**
- ✅ Page 1: Dashboard (`/`) - PASS (no bugs)
- ✅ Page 2: Clients - List (`/clients`) - PASS (no bugs)
- ⏳ Page 3: Clients - Detail (`/clients/:id`) - User was about to start Group A checks
- Remaining: 42 pages untested

## Remaining Work

**Task 2: Test Admin Dashboard (42/44 pages remaining)**
- Page 3: Clients - Detail - START HERE when resuming
- Pages 4-44: All pending (see TEST-MATRIX.md for full list)

**Task 3: Test Client Portal (7 pages)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 4: Test Super Admin (4 pages)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 5: Test Public/Auth (4 pages)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 6: Test E2E Workflows (4 workflows)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 7: Mobile Testing (Selective)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 8: Dark Mode Testing (Selective)** - NOT STARTED

**Task 9: Update TEST-MATRIX.md Summary** - NOT STARTED

## Decisions Made

1. **Testing Approach Confirmed**
   - MANUAL testing (user tests pages, Claude provides checklist)
   - 27 checks per page (9 Functionality, 10 UI/UX, 8 Interactions)
   - Bug documentation: BUGS-PHASE-18.md + GitHub Issues immediately
   - Rationale: User clarified this was always the plan

2. **Test Credentials Fixed**
   - User: alice@studiopro.com (User ID: 3)
   - Organization: Studio Pro (Org ID: 1)
   - Tenant: tenant_1
   - Committed in previous session

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Update TEST-MATRIX.md after each page tested
   - Commit progress every 5-10 pages
   - Document bugs immediately when found

## Blockers

**None currently** - Environment stable, ready to continue testing.

## Context

**What happened this session:**
- User resumed Phase 18-02 with `/gsd:resume-work`
- I mistakenly started at Dashboard (page 1) thinking we were at the beginning
- User corrected: "on en était à la page client" (we were at clients page)
- Confirmed: Pages 1-2 already tested and passed, ready for Page 3

**Testing Strategy:**
- 58 pages × 27 checks = 1,566 total validations
- Estimated 2-3 days intensive manual testing
- Focus: Find P0/P1/P2 bugs (Zero-Bug requirement)

**Mental Model:**
Claude = QA guide with checklist. For each page:
1. Claude provides 27 checks in 3 groups (A/B/C)
2. User validates each group
3. User reports PASS/FAIL + bug description
4. Claude documents bugs → BUGS-PHASE-18.md + GitHub Issue
5. Update TEST-MATRIX.md status
6. Move to next page

**Key Files:**
- `.planning/phases/18-audit-complet-toutes-pages-zero-bug/TEST-MATRIX.md` - Testing checklist (58 pages)
- `.planning/phases/18-audit-complet-toutes-pages-zero-bug/18-02-PLAN.md` - Detailed plan
- `packages/client/src/main.tsx:54-57` - Test headers (committed)

## Next Action

**When resuming:**

1. **Start Page 3: Clients - Detail** (`/clients/:id`)
   - User navigates to any client detail page (click client from `/clients`)
   - Claude provides Group A checks (9 Functionality checks)
   - User validates and reports results
   - Claude provides Group B checks (10 UI/UX checks)
   - User validates and reports results
   - Claude provides Group C checks (8 Interactions checks)
   - User validates and reports results
   - Document any bugs found → BUGS-PHASE-18.md + GitHub Issue
   - Update TEST-MATRIX.md status (PASS/FAIL)
   - Move to Page 4

2. **Continue systematic testing through all 58 pages**

3. **Commit progress every 5-10 pages**

**First prompt when resuming:**
"Resuming Phase 18-02. Ready to test Page 3: Clients - Detail. Navigate to `/clients/:id` and I'll guide you through Group A (Functionality) checks."

## Files Modified (Uncommitted)

**None** - Previous session committed test header changes.

**Commits this session:**
- Attempted: `git commit -m "fix(dev): update test headers to org 1 for Phase 18-02 testing"`
- Status: Failed due to untracked files in worktrees and scripts
- Action needed: None, test headers already committed in previous session

## Testing Progress Summary

**Pages Tested:** 2/58 (3%)
- ✅ Dashboard - PASS
- ✅ Clients List - PASS

**Bugs Found:** 0 P0/P1/P2 (Zero-Bug requirement met so far)

**Next:** Page 3: Clients - Detail
