# Phase 18-02: Manual Testing Paused

## Current State

**Location:** Phase 18-02 - Execute Manual Tests with MCP Chrome
**Progress:** 2/58 pages tested (3%)
**Currently testing:** Admin Dashboard - Clients section (page 2/5 complete)
**Environment:** Localhost:5174 running, logged in as admin@test-studio-ui.com

**Immediate context:** User started manual testing session, completed Dashboard and Clients List. User pointed out that Clients section is incomplete (Detail/Create/Edit pages not tested yet). Paused before continuing with remaining Clients pages.

## Completed Work

**Phase 18-01:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Created TEST-MATRIX.md with 58 pages
- Defined bug severity levels (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Established testing protocol (27 checks per page)

**Phase 18-02 - Tasks Complete:**
- Task 1: ✅ Environment Setup (5 min) - Chrome, DevTools, login verified
- Task 2: ⏸️ Test Admin Dashboard (44 pages) - **2/44 pages complete**
  - ✅ Page 1: Dashboard - PASS (all checks)
  - ✅ Page 2: Clients - List - PASS (all checks)
  - ⏸️ **PAUSED HERE** before testing pages 3-5 (Clients Detail/Create/Edit)

**Bugs found so far:**
- 0 bugs (P0/P1/P2/P3 all at 0)
- Previous bugs (BUG-001, BUG-003, BUG-004, BUG-005) were fixed in Phases 18.1 and 18.2

## Remaining Work

**Immediate next (Clients section - 3 pages):**
- [ ] Page 3: Clients - Detail (`/clients/:id`) - Test detail view with vCard enrichment, notes history, multi-tab form
- [ ] Page 4: Clients - Create (`/clients/create`) - Test form with Phase 5 enrichment fields, type toggle (individual/company), arrays (phones/emails/addresses)
- [ ] Page 5: Clients - Edit (`/clients/:id/edit`) - Test modification, pre-filled form, validation

**Then continue Admin Dashboard (39 pages):**
- [ ] Pages 6-9: Sessions (List, Detail, Create, Edit)
- [ ] Pages 10-14: Projects + Tracks (List, Detail, Create, Upload, Detail)
- [ ] Pages 15-25: v4.0 Features (Quotes, Invoices, Time Tracking - 11 pages)
- [ ] Pages 26-29: Reports & Analytics (4 pages)
- [ ] Pages 30-44: Configuration (Team, Rooms, Equipment, Service Catalog, Settings - 15 pages)

**Other sections (14 pages):**
- [ ] Task 3: Client Portal (7 pages) - Estimated 3-4 hours
- [ ] Task 4: Super Admin (4 pages) - Estimated 1-2 hours
- [ ] Task 5: Public/Auth (3 pages) - Estimated 1 hour

**Post-testing tasks:**
- [ ] Task 6: E2E Workflows (4 workflows) - 2-3 hours
- [ ] Task 7: Mobile Testing (selective) - 2-3 hours
- [ ] Task 8: Dark Mode Testing (selective) - 1-2 hours
- [ ] Task 9: Update TEST-MATRIX.md Summary

## Decisions Made

**Testing approach:**
- Manual testing with MCP Chrome DevTools (not automated Playwright)
- 27 checks per page (9 functionality, 10 UI/UX, 8 interactions)
- Test in logical groups (Clients → Sessions → Projects → etc.)
- Commit progress every 5-10 pages
- Zero-bug requirement: P0/P1/P2 must be 0 before Phase 18 complete

**Test environment:**
- Using Organization 16 (Test Studio UI) with pre-populated test data
- Login: admin@test-studio-ui.com / password
- 5 clients, 8 sessions, 4 projects available for testing
- Testing on localhost:5174 (development mode, not production)

**Bug documentation:**
- Create BUG-XXX entries in TEST-MATRIX.md
- Severity based on defined criteria (P0=blocker, P1=critical, P2=important, P3=minor)
- Include steps to reproduce, console errors, screenshots if visual

## Blockers

**None currently.**

Environment is operational:
- ✅ Chrome running
- ✅ Frontend localhost:5174 accessible
- ✅ Backend port 3001 operational
- ✅ PostgreSQL accessible
- ✅ tenant_16 has test data
- ✅ No P0/P1 blockers from previous sessions

## Context

**Mental state:** User is executing systematic manual testing to achieve zero-bug quality. Already validated 2 pages (Dashboard, Clients List) with PASS status. User is methodical and caught that the Clients section wasn't finished before moving to Sessions.

**Testing vibe:** Thorough, systematic, quality-focused. User wants to complete sections fully before moving on (good discipline). Testing is going well - no bugs found in first 2 pages suggests app is in good shape.

**Key insight:** This is a **human-executed task**, not Claude automation. My role is to guide, provide testing instructions, document bugs when reported, and create fix plans when testing is complete.

**Timeline expectation:**
- User is pacing testing over multiple days (not rushing)
- 2-3 days intensive OR 1 week casual pace
- Will report back when sections complete or bugs found

## Next Action

**When resuming:**

1. **Verify environment still running:**
   ```bash
   # Check frontend
   curl http://localhost:5174

   # Check backend
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

2. **Login to app:** http://localhost:5174 with admin@test-studio-ui.com / password

3. **Open TEST-MATRIX.md:** Keep it open in editor for real-time updates

4. **Continue testing Clients section (3 pages):**
   - Page 3: Clients - Detail
   - Page 4: Clients - Create
   - Page 5: Clients - Edit

5. **For each page:** Run 27 checks, document results, update TEST-MATRIX.md

6. **Commit after Clients section complete:**
   ```bash
   git add .planning/phases/18-audit-complet-toutes-pages-zero-bug/TEST-MATRIX.md
   git commit -m "test(18-02): complete Clients section - 5/5 pages tested"
   ```

7. **Report progress:** Let Claude know results (PASS count, bugs found) before moving to Sessions

**User command when ready:** `/gsd:resume-work` OR just say "continue testing"

## Files Modified

**Uncommitted changes:**
- `.planning/phases/18-audit-complet-toutes-pages-zero-bug/TEST-MATRIX.md` - Progress tracked (2/58 pages marked ✅ PASS)
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Needs update after session complete

**Pending commits:**
- None - User hasn't started modifying TEST-MATRIX.md with Clients Detail/Create/Edit results yet
- Will commit after completing Clients section (5 pages total)

## Notes

- **TEST-MATRIX.md structure:** Each page has status (✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL / ⏸️ Not Tested), bugs referenced as BUG-XXX
- **Bug numbering:** Continues from BUG-005 (last bug fixed in Phase 18.2), next bug would be BUG-006
- **Screenshot location:** `.planning/phases/18-audit-complet-toutes-pages-zero-bug/screenshots/` (if needed)
- **Total testing estimate:** 18-28 hours remaining (56 pages × 20-30 min avg)
