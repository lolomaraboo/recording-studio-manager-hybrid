# Phase 18.4: Music Profile for Artists - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Add comprehensive music profile fields to client records for recording studio management. Enriches artist/musician clients with genres, instruments, streaming platform links, industry contacts, and career information. This is ONLY about adding music-specific fields to existing client records — not about creating new entities or workflows.

## Implementation Decisions

### UI — Layout & Organization

**Main view (always visible):**
- Genre badges WITH icons (separated from instruments)
- Instrument badges WITH icons (separated from genres)
- Both genres and instruments shown as separate rows with visual icons
- All selected genres/instruments visible (not just primary)

**Expandable panel "Informations Musicales":**
- Contains 3 sections:
  1. **Streaming platforms** (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Deezer, Tidal, Amazon Music, Audiomack, Beatport, + "Other Platforms")
  2. **Industry contacts** (Label, Distributor, Manager, Publisher, PRO)
  3. **Career info** (Years active, Notable works, Awards, Biography)
- Panel state: Remember user preference (collapsed/expanded) via localStorage
- Default: Collapsed on first visit, then remembers user choice

### Content — Data Structure

**Genres:**
- Two-level hierarchy: 15+ parent genres → subgenres
- Parent genres: Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, Electronic, Jazz, Classical, R&B/Soul, Country, Metal, Folk, Reggae, Latin, World, Blues, Gospel, Experimental, Soundtrack
- Editable/customizable: Users can add custom parent genres and subgenres
- Stored as JSONB array in database with GIN index

**Instruments:**
- Hierarchical structure: 12+ instrument families → specific instruments
- Families: Vocals, Guitar, Keys, Drums/Percussion, Bass, Strings, Brass, Woodwinds, Electronic Production, World Instruments, DJ/Turntables, Sound Design, Other
- Editable/customizable: Users can add custom families and instruments
- Stored as JSONB array in database with GIN index

**Streaming Platforms:**
- 10+ dedicated fields: Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Deezer, Tidal, Amazon Music, Audiomack, Beatport
- Generic "Other Platforms" field for custom URLs
- All fields stored as varchar (URL strings)

**Industry Contacts:**
- 5 optional fields: Label, Distributor, Manager, Publisher, PRO (Performance Rights Organization)
- All fields text/varchar
- No required fields

**Career Info:**
- 4 optional fields:
  1. Years active (text/varchar, e.g., "2015-present" or "2010-2018")
  2. Notable works (text field, free-form)
  3. Awards/Recognition (text field, free-form)
  4. Biography (longer text field, artist story)
- All fields optional

### Behavior — Data Entry & Validation

**Genre/Instrument Selection:**
- Dual entry method:
  1. **Autocomplete** for quick add (type to search, click to add tag)
  2. **Modal** for browsing presets (organized by parent categories)
- Users can switch between both methods based on preference

**Custom Entries:**
- When user adds custom genre/instrument NOT in presets:
  - Automatically added to studio's custom preset list
  - Available for all future artists in this organization
  - Enables smart reuse across clients

**URL Validation:**
- No validation for streaming platform URLs
- Free-text fields — trust users to paste correct links
- No format checking or API verification

**Required Fields:**
- All music profile fields completely optional
- No minimum requirements for genres, instruments, or any other fields
- Studios add information as they learn about artists

**Empty State:**
- When artist has no music profile data:
  - Show quick-add buttons: "+ Genre", "+ Instrument", "+ Streaming"
  - Inline actions — no need to enter edit mode
  - Fast data entry from empty state

## Specific Ideas

**Visual Design:**
- Genre badges use genre-specific icons (🎸 Rock, 🎹 Jazz, etc.)
- Instrument badges use instrument-specific icons (🎸 Guitar, 🎤 Vocals, 🥁 Drums, etc.)
- Separate visual treatment for genres vs instruments (different badge colors or styles)

**Preset Management:**
- Studio-level customization: Each organization builds their own extended preset list
- First custom entry creates it, subsequent artists can select from expanded presets
- Encourages consistent categorization across studio's client base

**Panel Behavior:**
- localStorage key: `client-music-profile-expanded-${clientId}` or global `music-profile-panel-state`
- Smooth expand/collapse animation
- Panel remembers state across page refreshes
