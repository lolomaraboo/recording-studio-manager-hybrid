# Phase 11.5 Plan 02: Service Catalog Management Page Summary

**Dedicated Services page with full CRUD interface, search/filter, and sidebar navigation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-06T04:33:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-06T04:36:44Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Created /services page with table view displaying all catalog columns (Nom, Catégorie, Prix, TVA, Qté défaut, Actions)
- Implemented real-time debounced search (300ms) with fuzzy match on name/description
- Added category filter dropdown with 4 categories (Studio, Post-production, Location matériel, Autre)
- Built create/edit modal with 6-field form (name, description, category, unitPrice, taxRate, defaultQuantity)
- Integrated client-side validation with error messages for all required fields
- Added delete confirmation AlertDialog with safety warning about existing quotes
- Registered /services route in App.tsx router
- Added Services link to Sidebar in CONTACTS section (positioned between Clients and Talents)
- Applied UI harmonization patterns from Phase 3.14 (container spacing, icon sizing, card structure)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/client/src/pages/Services.tsx` - New page (519 lines) with full CRUD interface
- `packages/client/src/App.tsx` - Added /services route and import
- `packages/client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Added Services navigation link in Contacts section

## Decisions Made

- **Services positioned in CONTACTS section**: Logical grouping (Clients → Services → Talents) as services are client-facing offerings, not internal resources
- **TVA dropdown with 6 rates**: 20% (Standard), 10%, 5.5%, 5% (Super réduit), 2.1%, 0% (Exonéré) - covers all common EU VAT scenarios
- **Delete warning mentions quotes impact**: "Les devis existants utilisant ce service ne seront pas affectés" - clarifies that catalog deletion doesn't break historical data
- **Package icon for Services**: Catalog/inventory metaphor (box of pre-packaged offerings)
- **Default quantity pre-filled to 1.00**: Most common case for service catalog items (1 hour, 1 session, 1 rental)
- **300ms debounce on search**: Balance between responsiveness and API call frequency (same pattern as global search)
- **Real-time search on name AND description**: Fuzzy match increases discoverability (user can search partial words in either field)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. All 3 tasks completed successfully with standard CRUD patterns.

## Issues Encountered

None - straightforward CRUD page implementation following established patterns from Clients.tsx and Rooms.tsx.

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for 11.5-03-PLAN.md: Quote Builder Integration
- Service catalog CRUD complete and functional
- Search/filter working for service discovery
- Next: Add autocomplete + catalog modal to quote line item builder
