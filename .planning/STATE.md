## Accumulated Context

### Major Features Discovered (Not Originally in GSD Planning)

**During comprehensive audits (2025-12-26, 2025-12-31), discovered 93+ implemented features not documented:**

1. **AI Chatbot COMPLET (40 AI tools)** - SSE streaming, anti-hallucination detection (4 rules), Playwright tests 4/4 passing
2. **Client Portal COMPLET (10 features)** - Email/password, magic link, password reset, booking, payments, dashboard, profile, activity logs, device fingerprinting, ownership verification
3. **Audio System professionnel** - Upload Cloudinary, versioning 4 versions (demo/rough/final/master), AudioPlayer custom HTML5 (227 lines), TrackDetail 3 Phase 5 cards
4. **20 UX Components avancés** - Command Palette (Cmd+K), Notification Center, Dark/Light Theme, Global Search, Toast, Breadcrumbs, Status Badges, Loading Skeletons, Delete Confirmations, Responsive Mobile, French date formatting, Type-safe end-to-end
5. **Testing infrastructure** - Playwright E2E (8 test files: auth, command-palette, ai-chatbot, global-search, ui-validation, navigation, complete-journeys, production-health), Vitest unit (3 test files: connection, projects integration, routers)
6. **Tracks enrichment** - 17 nouveaux champs Phase 5 (copyright metadata 8 fields, technical details 5 fields, versioning 4 fields)
7. **Database schema** - 32 PostgreSQL tables (7 master + 25 per tenant) - Comprehensive multi-tenant architecture
8. **Git history** - 152 commits in 7 days (Dec 24-31, 2025) - Intensive development (21.7 commits/day average)

**Phase 5 Mystery RESOLVED:**
- TODO_MASTER showed "11/12 items (92%)" but didn't list Item 11
- Audit discovered: Item 11 = Documentation Phase 5 (FAIT Session 4), Item 12 = Tests E2E (optionnel)
- **Phase 5 = 100% fonctionnel** même sans tests E2E formels (tests manuels validés)

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Init | Database-per-Tenant architecture | Isolation données maximale, conformité RGPD, performance indépendante par tenant vs Single-DB organizationId filter |
| Init | Phase 5 avant Phase 4.3 P2 | Projects Management = feature différenciante business > optimisations infrastructure invisibles |
| Init | Production VPS unique vs multi-région | Budget-conscious, scaling basé tenants réels. Multi-région AWS = $500+/mois prématuré |
| Init | CORS HTTPS fix prioritaire | Backend accepte http:// mais bloque https:// → Production broken, blocage critique |
| Init | Pricing tiers €29/€99/€299 | Adresser tous segments (Starter petits studios, Pro moyens, Enterprise gros) |
| Init | English-first, i18n v2.0 | Marché US/UK = 60%+ studios, i18n = 6 semaines dev. Canada/Europe après traction |
| Init | Stripe billing vs custom | Time-to-market, PCI compliance gratuit. Custom billing = 4+ semaines overhead |
| Init | Monitoring basique v1.0 | <100 tenants = health checks + Sentry suffit. Prometheus/Grafana = overhead ops prématuré |
| 1 | CORS regex pattern over static array | Dynamic origin callback with regex allows flexible subdomain matching vs hardcoded list. Maintains security with pattern validation. |
| 1 | Docker restart vs rebuild for deployment | Server uses tsx (no build step), restart sufficient to load new code. Rebuild would fail (no dist/ directory). |
| 1 | Automated Playwright verification | Repeatable validation > manual testing. Created test suite for future regression testing of HTTPS/CORS. |
| 1 | Uptime Kuma over UptimeRobot | Self-hosted monitoring provides more control, no external dependencies. User-requested alternative to SaaS monitoring. |
| 1 | 60-second heartbeat interval | Balanced monitoring frequency for early problem detection without excessive overhead on free tier. |
| 1 | Sentry DSN configuration deferred | Code infrastructure ready in both backend and frontend. Environment variables to be added when Sentry project created. |
| 1 | Automated testing over manual validation | Created Playwright test suite for repeatable validation and CI/CD readiness. Enables regression testing for future deploys. |
| 1 | Docker image rebuild for production fixes | Server image rebuilt with tenant provisioning fix to ensure persistence across container restarts. |
| 1 | Test account kept active in production | test-validation-1766731401390@recording-studio-manager.com remains for future regression testing and validation. |
| 2 | Test Strategy with Authentication Caveat | Registration doesn't auto-login users (likely intentional for security). Test implements graceful degradation - validates UI structure exists when authenticated. Trade-off: Full automation requires auth fix OR test-only bypass. |
| 2 | Behavioral integration testing over full CRUD mocking | Instead of complex Drizzle ORM mocks (300+ lines, brittle on ORM updates), focused integration tests on router structure, auth middleware, and input validation. E2E tests (02-01) already validate full CRUD flows with real DB. Better ROI: 24 solid tests in 200 lines vs fragile mocks. |
| 3 | Stripe SDK in database package for seeding | Added stripe@20.1.0 to database package to enable subscription plans seed script. Reuses existing Stripe SDK version from server package. Alternative would be manual Stripe API setup requiring duplicate code. |
| 3 | Subscription email templates deferred to Phase 6 | Webhook handlers mark email functions as TODO (sendSubscriptionConfirmationEmail, sendPaymentFailedEmail). Phase 6 (Support & Documentation) will implement all email templates together. Core subscription flow functional without emails. |
| 3 | Storage check in updateVersionUrl endpoint | Plan suggested uploadTrack endpoint, but actual router uses updateVersionUrl pattern. Added optional fileSizeMB parameter for flexibility and consistency with existing architecture. |
| 3 | TenantDb type for middleware | Used PostgresJsDatabase (TenantDb) instead of NodePgDatabase as codebase uses postgres.js adapter consistently. Maintains type safety across middleware and routers. |
| 3.1 | Cookie domain with leading dot | `.recording-studio-manager.com` (with dot) enables subdomain cookie sharing per RFC standard vs wildcard patterns. Required for multi-tenant authentication. |
| 3.1 | Trust proxy configuration | `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` instead of array/function for single Nginx proxy. Simple case, no need for complex trust logic. |
| 3.1 | sameSite: lax vs none | Chose 'lax' for balance of security and usability. Allows top-level navigation, blocks CSRF without requiring always-secure like 'none'. |
| 3.1 | Direct tsx command in Dockerfile | Avoid pnpm wrapper to prevent runtime DNS lookups. Workaround for VPS systemd-resolved issues where containers can't resolve DNS via 127.0.0.53. |
| 3.1 | Port 3002 vs debugging 3001 | Changed production port instead of debugging orphaned docker-proxy processes. Pragmatic choice - faster deployment, equally effective. |
| 3.1 | Google DNS in daemon.json | Use 8.8.8.8 instead of host resolver for container DNS. systemd-resolved (127.0.0.53) doesn't work inside Docker containers on Ubuntu 24.04. |
| 3.8.1 | Docker rebuild deployment strategy | Client container builds from source (not pre-built dist/), so deployment requires: rsync source → rebuild image → restart container. Discovered after attempting dist/ rsync (files not served due to baked-in image). |
| 3.8.4 | Shared Qdrant infrastructure | Reused existing Qdrant Docker container (running for 6 weeks, shared with mem0-api) instead of creating dedicated instance. Payload-based multi-tenancy via organizationId filtering ensures secure isolation. |
| 3.8.4 | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small | Selected for 5x cost efficiency ($0.02 vs $0.10/M tokens) compared to ada-002, same quality at 1536 dimensions. |
| 3.8.4 | Payload-based multi-tenancy | Official Qdrant best practice - single collection with organizationId filters instead of separate collections per tenant. Better performance and simpler management. |
| 3.8.4 | Conditional RAG strategy | Recent context (15 messages) loaded always for continuity, RAG retrieval triggered only on memory keywords (4 patterns). Zero latency for 80% normal questions, +200ms for 20% memory queries. Fire-and-forget Qdrant storage prevents response blocking. |
| 3.9 | Environment variable authentication | Used `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` env var instead of hardcoded email for security and configurability |
| 3.9 | Read-only Docker operations | Prevented container restart/stop/exec for safety, only monitoring operations exposed |
| 3.9 | Password filtering | Excluded password hashes from user list endpoint for security |
| 3.9 | Pagination default 50 | Scalable approach for large datasets in listOrganizations and listUsers |
| 3.9 | Dedicated SuperAdmin sidebar layout | User explicitly requested "les trois onglets devrait etre dans la sidebar et on devrait avoir que ca dedans" - completely separate layout from normal dashboard with only 3 superadmin menu items (Services, Database, Logs). Improved UX clarity and admin workflow isolation. |

### Deferred Issues

See `.planning/ISSUES.md` for full details and resolution steps.

### Roadmap Evolution

- **2025-12-26:** Phase 3.1 inserted after Phase 3 - "Fix Production Authentication 401 Errors" (URGENT)
  - Reason: Critical production blocker discovered - all API endpoints returning 401 Unauthorized
  - Impact: All tRPC queries/mutations failing, WebSocket authentication broken
  - Symptoms: User reported console errors showing `GET /api/trpc/* 401`, `[WebSocket] No authentication token found`
  - Priority: BLOCKER - Must resolve before Phase 4 (Marketing) as product is currently inaccessible
- **2025-12-26:** Phase 3.2 inserted after Phase 3.1 - "End-to-End Testing" (INSERTED)
  - Reason: Validate full user journey before marketing launch
  - Impact: Comprehensive E2E tests ensure production quality before driving traffic
  - Scope: Signup → Dashboard → Booking → Payment → Project → Track upload → AI chatbot
  - Priority: Quality gate before Phase 4 (Marketing Foundation)
- **2025-12-26:** Phase 3.3 inserted after Phase 3.2 - "Fix Registration Session Persistence" (URGENT BLOCKER)
  - Reason: MCP Chrome DevTools testing revealed session not persisted after registration
  - Impact: After successful registration (200 OK), auth.me returns null, all protected endpoints return 401
  - Symptoms: 29 console errors "401 Unauthorized", user appears logged in visually but session invalid
  - Root Cause: auth.register endpoint creates user but doesn't persist session in Redis/req.session
  - Affected: All protected tRPC endpoints (notifications, organizations, clients, rooms, equipment, projects, sessions, invoices)
  - Priority: CRITICAL BLOCKER - Application completely non-functional after registration
- **2025-12-26:** Phase 3.4 added after Phase 3.3 - "Comprehensive Site Testing" (INSERTED)
  - Reason: Exhaustive testing of entire site before marketing launch
  - Impact: Validate ALL functionality works - Admin Dashboard (47 pages), Client Portal (5 pages), all workflows, all interactions
  - Approach: Document ALL errors first, plan fixes, then code - systematic quality assurance
  - Priority: Quality gate ensuring production-ready before public launch (Phase 4)
  - Plans: 3.4-01 (test matrix) → 3.4-02 (execute tests) → 3.4-03 (document errors) → 3.4-04+ (fix critical errors)
  - **Update 2025-12-27:** 3.4-01 complete - Created 600+ item test coverage matrix, MCP Chrome DevTools protocol, error tracking system
- **2025-12-28:** Phase 3.5 inserted after Phase 3.4 - "Password Confirmation Field" (INSERTED)
  - Reason: UX improvement to prevent password typos during registration
  - Impact: Standard best practice for account creation forms
  - Duration: ~20 min (client-side validation, quick deployment)
  - Priority: Pre-launch UX polish before marketing (Phase 4)
- **2025-12-28:** Phase 3.6 inserted after Phase 3.5 - "Breadcrumb Navigation" (INSERTED)
  - Reason: User discovered inconsistent UX - some pages have back arrow to dashboard, others don't
  - Impact: 12 pages missing breadcrumb navigation (Talents, Team, Rooms, Equipment, FinancialReports, Analytics, Reports, Projects, Tracks, Shares, Chat, Notifications)
  - Approach: Replicate breadcrumb pattern from Clients.tsx to all 12 pages
  - Duration: ~20 min (simple pattern replication)
  - Priority: Pre-launch UX consistency before marketing (Phase 4)
- **2025-12-28:** Phase 3.7 inserted after Phase 3.6 - "AI Chatbot Cache Invalidation" (INSERTED)
  - Reason: User discovered UX bug - after creating client via chatbot, must refresh page to see it in list
  - Impact: All chatbot mutations (create/update/delete clients, sessions, invoices, etc.) don't update UI automatically
  - Root cause: AIAssistant.tsx doesn't invalidate tRPC caches after chatbot actions
  - Solution: Add `trpc.useUtils()` and invalidate appropriate queries based on action type
  - Duration: ~20-30 min (standard tRPC pattern)
  - Priority: Critical UX bug before marketing launch (Phase 4)
- **2025-12-29:** Phase 3.8 inserted after Phase 3.7 - "Vérifier Chatbot Mémoire" (INSERTED - URGENT)
  - Reason: Need to verify AI chatbot maintains conversation context throughout multi-turn discussions
  - Impact: Critical UX concern - if chatbot loses context, becomes frustrating and unhelpful to users
  - Scope: Test conversation history persistence, Claude API context management, token limits
  - Priority: URGENT - Must validate before marketing launch (Phase 4) as chatbot is core differentiating feature
  - Research needed: Anthropic Claude API conversation management, session storage patterns
- **2025-12-29:** Phase 3.8.1 inserted after Phase 3.8 - "Fix Chatbot SessionId Persistence Bug" (URGENT - CRITICAL BLOCKER)
  - Reason: Phase 3.8 testing discovered CRITICAL P0 BUG - chatbot creates new session for each message, complete memory loss
  - Impact: Chatbot memory completely non-functional, makes feature nearly useless, would cause immediate negative reviews
  - Root cause: Frontend AIAssistant.tsx never sends sessionId to backend, backend creates new session every time
  - Fix: Simple React state management (15-20 min) - add sessionId state, send in requests, store from responses
  - Priority: CRITICAL BLOCKER - Marketing launch cannot proceed until chatbot memory works
  - Testing: Phase 3.8 stopped at Turn 2 when memory failure confirmed, must re-run after fix
- **2025-12-29:** Phase 3.8.2 inserted after Phase 3.8.1 - "Persist Chatbot SessionId in LocalStorage" (URGENT)
  - Reason: User discovered sessionId lost on page refresh - conversation not persisted across browser refreshes
  - Impact: Users lose entire conversation context when accidentally refreshing page or navigating away
  - Current behavior: sessionId stored in React state only, resets to null on component unmount/remount
  - User request: Implement localStorage persistence (Option 1) to maintain conversations across refreshes
  - Priority: URGENT - UX improvement before marketing launch (Phase 4)
- **2025-12-29:** Phase 3.8.3 inserted after Phase 3.8.2 - "Fix Chatbot Date Awareness - Add Current Date to System Context" (URGENT)
  - Reason: User reported chatbot doesn't know today's date - cannot help with scheduling or time-sensitive queries
  - Impact: Chatbot unable to answer "schedule for tomorrow", "this week", or provide date-aware responses
  - Solution: Add current date to Claude API system prompt in backend (e.g., "Today is 2025-12-29")
  - Priority: URGENT - UX issue affecting chatbot utility before marketing launch (Phase 4)
- **2025-12-29:** Phase 3.8.4 inserted after Phase 3.8.3 - "Implement RAG with Qdrant for Chatbot Long-Term Memory" (INSERTED)
  - Reason: User requested RAG implementation to enable scalable long-term memory for chatbot
  - Impact: Replace full conversation history loading with semantic search for 500+ message conversations
  - Current limitation: Context window approach loads ALL messages, doesn't scale beyond 50-100 messages
  - Proposed solution: Qdrant vector database + embeddings for semantic retrieval of relevant messages
  - Benefits: Cross-session memory, token efficiency, better context relevance
  - Trade-offs: Infrastructure complexity (self-host Docker on VPS = €0 OR Qdrant Cloud free tier 1GB), development time (3-5 days)
  - Infrastructure options: (1) Self-hosted Docker on existing VPS Hostinger (€0 extra), (2) Qdrant Cloud free tier (1GB, ~1M vectors)
  - Priority: ENHANCEMENT - Evaluate necessity before marketing launch (Phase 4)
- **2025-12-29:** Phase 3.9.1 inserted after Phase 3.9 - "Notes avec historique daté pour clients" (INSERTED)
  - Reason: User requested dated notes history feature - "je voudrais qu'on puisse prendre une note la sauvegarder, et ainsi avoir un historique daté de toutes les notes"
  - Impact: Transform single notes field into timestamped history system for better client relationship management
  - Current limitation: Single textarea overwrites previous notes, no history, no timestamps
  - Proposed solution: New client_notes table with timestamps, chronological display, audit trail
  - Benefits: Track communication history, professional CRM feature, better client management
  - Priority: UX ENHANCEMENT - Professional feature before marketing launch (Phase 4)
- **2025-12-29:** Phase 3.9.2 inserted after Phase 3.9.1 - "Chatbot accès notes clients" (INSERTED)
  - Reason: Enable AI chatbot to manage client notes via natural language
  - Impact: Chatbot can read notes history, add dated notes, delete notes via AI tools
  - Solution: 3 new AI tools (get_client_notes, add_client_note, delete_client_note) + SSE real-time UI refresh
  - Priority: UX ENHANCEMENT - AI integration for professional CRM feature
- **2025-12-29:** Phase 3.9.3 inserted after Phase 3.9.2 - "Fix chatbot input focus bug" (URGENT)
  - Reason: Chatbot textarea remains focused when clicking outside, prevents typing in other inputs
  - Impact: User cannot add client notes while chatbot is open - textarea steals focus
  - Expected: Textarea should blur when clicking outside chatbot area
  - Priority: URGENT - UX blocker preventing simultaneous chatbot + page interaction
- **2026-01-04:** Phase 3.11 inserted after Phase 3.10 - "Rangement et nettoyage du dossier" (INSERTED)
  - Reason: Organiser et nettoyer le dossier de projet avant le lancement marketing
  - Impact: Maintenir une codebase propre et professionnelle, supprimer fichiers obsolètes, organiser documentation
  - Scope: Suppression fichiers temporaires, organisation documentation, validation structure projet, nettoyage code mort
  - Priority: ORGANISATION - Qualité et maintenabilité avant Phase 4 (Marketing Foundation)
