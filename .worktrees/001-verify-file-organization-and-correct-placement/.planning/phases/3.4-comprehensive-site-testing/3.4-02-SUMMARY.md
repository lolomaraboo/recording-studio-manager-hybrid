## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/ERRORS-FOUND.md` - 6 errors documented with screenshots, reproduction steps, impact analysis, fix plans
- `.planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/screenshots/` - 10 page screenshots (dashboard, clients, sessions, projects, invoices, quotes, rooms, equipment, calendar, settings)
- `.planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/errors/` - 1 error screenshot (clients-400 validation bug)
- `.planning/phases/3.4-comprehensive-site-testing/TEST-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md` - Updated with ✅/❌/⏭️ marks for tested items

## Errors Found

**Summary:**
- Total: 6 errors
- P0 (Blocker): 0
- P1 (Critical): 1 ⚠️
- P2 (Important): 0
- P3 (Nice to have): 5

**Critical Error (P1):**

**Error #4: API validation bug - limit parameter mismatch**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Breaks core business functionality on /clients and /calendar pages
- **Symptoms:** Multiple 400 Bad Request errors, missing session counts and revenue totals
- **Root cause:** Frontend requests data with `limit=1000` but API max is `limit=100`
- **Affected pages:** /clients (session/revenue stats broken), /calendar (sessions won't load)
- **Fix:** Change frontend limit from 1000 to 100 in Clients and Calendar components
- **Priority:** P1 - Data availability bug preventing users from seeing critical business metrics

**Polish Issues (P3):**

1. **Error #1:** Missing vite.svg favicon (404) - Cosmetic console error
2. **Error #2:** WebSocket authentication warning on page load - Transient timing issue
3. **Error #3:** Form field missing id/name attribute - Accessibility issue (AI Assistant input)
4. **Error #5:** Form fields missing autocomplete attribute - UX/accessibility on Settings page
5. **Error #6:** Equipment page slow initial load - 10s timeout (renders eventually)

## Pages Tested

✅ **Clean pages (7):**
- Dashboard (3 P3 console warnings but functional)
- Sessions
- Projects
- Invoices
- Quotes
- Rooms
- Settings (2 P3 accessibility issues)

❌ **Pages with errors (3):**
- Clients (**P1 Critical** - limit bug)
- Calendar (**P1 Critical** - limit bug)
- Equipment (P3 - slow load)

## Decisions Made

- **Testing approach:** Continue systematic page-by-page testing with MCP Chrome DevTools
- **Error documentation:** Document all errors immediately (don't batch), include screenshots, impact analysis, fix plans
- **Checkpoint at 10 pages:** User review before continuing to remaining 37 admin pages
- **Priority focus:** P1 limit validation bug should be fixed before continuing extensive testing

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Tested 10 main pages, documented all errors, captured screenshots, reached checkpoint.

## Issues Encountered

None - MCP Chrome DevTools worked smoothly, all pages loaded (Equipment was slow but successful), testing workflow effective.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Testing progress:** 8% complete (50 of ~600 test items)

**User decision point (Checkpoint):**
1. **Continue testing** - Execute remaining 37 Admin pages with same workflow
2. **Pause to analyze** - Review 6 errors found, prioritize fixes, plan remediation

**Recommendation:**
- **Option A (Continue):** P1 limit bug is isolated and well-documented. Can continue testing to find all issues before batch fixing.
- **Option B (Fix P1 first):** Fix the limit bug now, verify fix works, then continue testing with corrected code.

Both options valid - P1 bug is serious but isolated to 2 pages. Remaining 37 pages likely won't have this specific issue (already tested 7 pages cleanly).
