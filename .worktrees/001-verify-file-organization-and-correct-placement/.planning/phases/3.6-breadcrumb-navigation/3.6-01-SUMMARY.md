### Implementation Pattern

Applied consistent breadcrumb pattern to all 12 pages:

```tsx
<Button variant="ghost" size="icon" asChild>
  <Link to="/dashboard">
    <ArrowLeft className="h-5 w-5" />
  </Link>
</Button>
```

**Location:** Inside page header, before page title (left side of header)

**Required imports added:**
- `ArrowLeft` from `lucide-react`
- `Link` from `react-router-dom`
- `Button` from `@/components/ui/button` (already present in most files)

### Deployment

1. Built Docker image locally with `--no-cache --pull` flags
2. Deployed modified files to VPS via rsync
3. Rebuilt client Docker image on VPS with `--no-cache`
4. Restarted client container
5. Verified breadcrumb navigation works in production

### Testing

Tested breadcrumb navigation on production (https://recording-studio-manager.com):
- ✅ Tracks page: Breadcrumb visible and functional
- ✅ Talents page: Breadcrumb visible and functional
- ✅ Analytics page: Breadcrumb visible and functional
- ✅ Navigation: Clicking back arrow successfully navigates to Dashboard

All 12 pages now have consistent breadcrumb navigation.

## Deviations from Plan

### Minor Issue Encountered

**Issue:** In `Tracks.tsx`, accidentally duplicated the `import { Link }` line during modification
**Fix:** Immediately removed the duplicate import
**Impact:** No impact on functionality, fixed before deployment

### Caching Challenge

**Issue:** After initial deployment, new breadcrumbs were not visible in browser
**Root cause:** Docker container was using old image SHA despite rebuild
**Resolution:**
- Stopped and removed client container
- Rebuilt with `--no-cache` flag
- Recreated container from scratch
- Breadcrumbs immediately visible after fresh build

## Outcomes

✅ All 12 pages now have breadcrumb navigation to Dashboard
✅ Consistent UX across entire admin interface
✅ Changes deployed and verified in production
✅ Commit created: `feat(3.6-01): Add breadcrumb navigation to 12 pages` (238dcce)
✅ Changes pushed to GitHub main branch
