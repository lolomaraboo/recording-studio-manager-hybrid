Project: Recording Studio Manager - File Organization Audit
Workspace: 001-verify-file-organization-and-correct-placement
Started: 2026-01-02 08:59:17

Workflow Type: investigation
Rationale: Read-only exploratory task focused on analyzing and documenting the current state
of codebase organization across all 4 packages (database, server, shared, client) and root
directory. No code changes - only assessment and reporting.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 4 (Inventory, Analyze, Detect Issues, Report)
- Total subtasks: 14
- Created init.sh
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:

Phase 1 - Complete Directory Inventory (investigation):
  - 3 subtasks, depends on []
  - Generate directory tree, inventory root files, survey packages

Phase 2 - File Location Analysis (investigation):
  - 5 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-inventory]
  - Identify misplaced tests, docs, images, scripts
  - Check package structure compliance

Phase 3 - Issue Detection (investigation):
  - 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-analyze]
  - Detect orphaned files, duplicates
  - Check .gitignore and config locations

Phase 4 - Generate Audit Report (implementation):
  - 4 subtasks (1 to create report, 3 to populate)
  - depends on [phase-3-detect-issues]
  - Create comprehensive markdown report with findings

Services Involved:
- All services (project-wide audit)
  - database: Drizzle ORM package
  - server: Express API backend
  - shared: Utility library
  - client: React + Vite frontend

Key Investigation Areas:
- Root directory: ~100+ files (many test files, scripts, images at root)
- Test files: 20+ .spec.ts, .mjs, .sh files scattered at root
- Documentation: 13+ .md files (some should be in docs/)
- Screenshots: Multiple .png files (should be in screenshots/)
- Scripts: Various .mjs and .sh files (should be in scripts/)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Sequential execution required
- Reasoning: Investigation workflow requires sequential analysis:
  inventory → analyze → detect issues → report generation

Verification Strategy:
- Risk level: trivial (read-only, zero code changes)
- Skip validation: false (minimal mode enabled)
- Manual checks only - verify report completeness
- No tests, security scans, or deployments required

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 1

Example with explicit spec number:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 1

=== EXPECTED OUTPUT ===

Deliverable: file-organization-audit-report.md

Report Sections:
- Executive Summary: High-level assessment of organization health
- Directory Structure Overview: Tree visualization
- Findings: Well-organized areas + issues detected
- Statistics: Total files, misplaced count, orphaned count
- Recommendations: Prioritized action items

=== CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS ===

⚠️  READ-ONLY TASK - NO FILE MODIFICATIONS ALLOWED
- Do not move, rename, or delete any files
- Do not modify any configuration files
- Only create the audit report file
- Verify git working tree stays clean (except report)

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Next session will be: Coder Agent (Implementation)
